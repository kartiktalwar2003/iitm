      Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular 
      have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal 
      for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.
      Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the 
      pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.
