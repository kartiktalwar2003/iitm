            HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.<br>
            The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial.<br>
            For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.

            HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>
            Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether.<br> 
            The latest version is known as HTML5.<br>
            A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented.<br>
            To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.

            What are Tags and Attributes?<br>
            Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.<br>
            <br>
            What Are HTML Tags?<br>
            Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets.<br>
            An example of a tag is: &lt;h1&gt.<br>
            <br>
            Most tags must be opened &lt;h1&gt and closed &lt;/h1&gt in order to function.<br>
